            If you're looking for a new to do weekend activity, or are
            interested in hiking as a hobby, this blog post is a walk through
            guide on the things you'll need and what the Blue Mountain Peak
            hiking experience is like.

            Since my initial discovery of The Ordinary, I've experimented with
            different products to figure out what works best for my skin and
            made a list of the products I found most effective. My main issues
            were hyperpigmentation and breakouts.

            The first time I visited Rick's Cafe and stared up at the cliff's
            pinnacle, I thought hmm.. doesn't actually look that scary, what are
            all these people going on about? When I actually got up there and
            looked down? Totally different story.

      <h2>MEET THE AUTHOR</h2>
      <img src="../images/placeholder150.png" alt="placeholder image" />
      <p>
        Hello guys, I‚Äôm Toni! I am a freelance writer and rookie blogger whose
        passions include creative writing, travel, art in all its forms and
        history. Thanks for stopping by :)
      </p>

      <h2>MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR</h2>

      <p>So I have officially entered the ‚Äúblogsphere‚Äù....</p>
      <img src="../images/placeholder150.png" alt="placeholder image" />
      <p>
        Starting a blog has been in the back of my mind for years, but of
        course, crippling anxiety (gotta love it) always held me back. I always
        thought a blog required a certain level of openness and that‚Äôs just
        never been who I thought I was. The anxiety is still here BUT I decided
        to do it anyway. Ultimately, I want to comfortably travel the world
        while writing ‚Äì both freelancing and creatively. Whoever you are,
        whenever you‚Äôre reading this, thank you for taking the time out of your
        day to stop by. Have a look around, and if you enjoy anything at all
        here, feel free to revisit üôÇ
      </p>
      <h2>MORE ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm 22 years old, I graduated from the University of the West Indies and
        earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Tourism Management Studies. I
        also work *now from home*, full time on an insurance account. My
        interests include Creative Writing, Books, Travel, Wellness, Skin+Hair
        care, D√©cor, Fashion, the list goes on. I am a bit of a history and
        literature nerd. I write a lot, I love to travel as much as the next gal
        (though my bank account says girl pls). My musical taste is quite
        eclectic- I listen to almost all genres, but my sweet spots include R&B,
        Jazz and Blues, and Country music. I try to practice a relatively
        minimalistic lifestyle. Lastly, I am genuinely trying my best to master
        personal finance, health and wellness, and the purpose of life
        simultaneously (send help). -Toni
